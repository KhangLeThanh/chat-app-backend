# Chat app

## Getting started

First make sure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. Once those are installed, you can get the app up and running with the following command.

```
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
```
